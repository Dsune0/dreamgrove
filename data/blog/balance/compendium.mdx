**You want to cancel !Nature's Grace! if you have any stacks before pulling a raid boss. This allows you to do the following opener, and still keep any stacks of !Nature's Grace! rolling into your cooldowns. Alternatively you can use a macro specified in the "Macros" section.**
- Use !Wrath!.
- Use !Wrath!.

You can precast 2 seconds before a boss is pulled.

**Keeper Explanation:** When playing Keeper of the Grove, your opener can vary depending on your distance to the target. The general rule is, you want both casts of !Wrath! to hit the boss before you use !205636|Force of Nature!, since !Wrath! consumes stacks of !Dream Surge! on impact. Usually this means using a global on !Moonfire! before !205636|Force of Nature!.

### **What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think of these as steps to be followed in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first ability on the list that you are able to cast, provided the conditions for its use are met.

## Single Target Priority

## Rotational Details

### Eclipses and Fillers

- On 1 target, enter Solar Eclipse and cast !Wrath!.
- On 2 targets and more, enter Lunar Eclipse and cast !Starfire!.
- If talented into Lunar Calling, enter Lunar Eclipse and cast !Starfire! at all times.

### How to Use Warrior of Elune

!Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it. It should be used on cooldown while talented into Lunar Calling, or you can hold for a few seconds to line up with !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation!.

When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! charges to enter Solar Eclipse.

### Control of the Dream vs. Power of the Dream

!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !Convoke the Spirits! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown.

Depending on the timer, this talent is stronger than !Power of the Dream! which it shares a choice node with. As always, you should research the fight you are preparing for on [warcraftlogs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) or sim your character and make an educated guess.

### How to use Owlkin Frenzy procs

Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets. Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.

Ring -  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot.

## Embellishments & Crafted Items

Embellishments for this season don't offer a substantial gain, so it's important that you always sim your character using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear) before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

[Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226024/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) and [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for both single target and AoE. The [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222561/darkmoon-sigil-ascension) can be crafted on any weapon. If you go this route, you should aim to craft this on a two-handed weapon early, and crafting the [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) on a 590 item level low stat budget slot without spending a spark, preferably on the cloak, belt or wrist slot. Keep in mind that this embellishment only stacks during combat, making it a lot less valuable in mythic+. For later in the season when you acquire a 639 weapon, you should recraft the Ascension embellishment on an off-hand.

[Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)
  - This is a solid all-round choice for single target and mythic+. It's a random damage proc effect, where the type of damage is determined based on what kind of gems you are wearing. Equipping more gems or changing the type does not matter for the damage output. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft two of them on low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, belt or wrist slots.

[Duskthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222873/duskthread-lining) or [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222869/dawnthread-lining)
  - These are buffs that give you versatility or critical strike when you're above 80% hp. They are decent choices for mythic+, depending on the uptime you can get. They're similiar to the Blue Silken Lining embellishment from Dragonflight. If you go for this choice, you should aim to craft them on two low stat budget slots, notably the cloak, wrist or belt slots.

Remember that you will acquire an enchanted heroic crest early in the season as a quest reward, allowing you to craft a 619 item without spending any of your crests.

## Trinkets

[Spymaster's Web](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202/spymasters-web) is a trinket with a passively stacking intellect buff, capping at 40 stacks and an on-use effect that gives you intellect based on the amount of stacks you've accumulated. Ideally this means you should save it for your 3rd or 2nd use of !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, depending on fight timer. 

Please use Top Gear on [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets.

# FAQ

### Why can't I enter Solar Eclipse?

- Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

- With !Astral Smolder!.

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

- Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### What is Astral damage?

- Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

- Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### Is there a target count where spreading Sunfire or Moonfire is not worth it?

- No, having your DoT effects up increases your damage done to the target. The conditions for spreading Sunfire and Moonfire are tied to how long the target will live, and not how many targets there are.

### How do I sim for AoE?

- It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

- If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

- Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### Why are some top players running different embellishments from the ones mentioned in the Compendium

- The DPS gain provided by the embellishments can vary significantly because of many external factors such as gear, type of content and group composition. Some of the top players might also happen to use niche embellishments for the same reasons. If you don't have any specific requirements then your best option is to just sim your character and choose the embellishments that provide the highest DPS upgrade.

### Do our dots snapshot?

- No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

## Macros

**Orbital Strike macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

**Force of Nature macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Force of Nature
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro (/13 for top trinket slot, and /14 for bottom trinket slot)

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Dreamstate**

This macro lets you cancel your !Nature's Grace! stacks while pre-casting before combat starts. This is entirely optional, but lets you skip the step of clicking away your buff.
```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura [nocombat] Dreamstate
/cast Wrath
```

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**Cancelling Starlord is entirely optional and is neither a DPS gain nor loss.**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a DPS loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura Starlord
```

## Useful WeakAuras and Other Profiles

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various Balance Druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [LuckyOneUI Druid](https://wago.io/LuckyoneUI-Druid)
- [Afenar The War Within](https://wago.io/HkrSdHFMG)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0F)

### Jundies Plater Profile

[This profile for Plater](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) is among the most used and asked about public nameplate profiles for moonkins, since it changes the color of a mobs nameplate based on what DoT effects are currently active on the target, being very helpful to more accurately spread your Sunfire and Moonfire when fighting multiple mobs at the same time.

### **Regrowth Tracker for Blooming Infusion**

[This weakaura](https://wago.io/WQiorkdEi) tracks your number of casts of Regrowth before you get the Blooming Infusion buff that increases the damage of your next Wrath/Starfire and makes them instant cast.

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
