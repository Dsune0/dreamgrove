### **What is a priority list?**

# FAQ

## Eclipses and Fillers

- On 1 target, enter Solar Eclipse and cast !Wrath!.
- On 2 targets and more, enter Lunar Eclipse and cast !Starfire!.
- If talented into Lunar Calling, enter Lunar Eclipse and cast !Starfire! at all times.

## How to Use Warrior of Elune

- !Warrior of Elune! is an off-gcd ability, making your next 3 !Starfire! instant for 25 seconds. The ability has a 45s cooldown that starts once you've pressed it.
- !Warrior of Elune! should be used on cooldown while talented into Lunar Calling, or held for up to 15 seconds to line up with !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation!.
- When not talented into Lunar Calling, use !Warrior of Elune! charges to enter Solar Eclipse. 

## How to Use Control of the Dream

!Control of the Dream! lets you hold on to either !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation!, !Convoke the Spirits! or !205636|Force of Nature! for up to 15 seconds without losing a use, subtracting the amount of time you held the ability from its cooldown. This is used to help you in consistently alining your cooldowns.

## How to use Owlkin Frenzy procs

- Use !Owlkin Frenzy! procs to enter Solar Eclipse, inside Lunar Eclipse or inside !194223|CA!/!102560|Incarnation! if Starfire will hit 2 or more targets.
- Keep in mind that !Warrior of Elune! charges are consumed before !Owlkin Frenzy! procs.

### Why can I not enter Solar Eclipse?

Because you are talented into !Lunar Calling!.

### How can I proc !Waning Twilight! without !Wild Mushroom! or !Stellar Flare!?

With !Astral Smolder!.

### I've read the priority list and I think my rotation looks correct but I'm still doing very low damage. What could be the reason?

Log one of your fights and check it with [warcraftlogs](https://articles.warcraftlogs.com/help/how-to-navigate-through-logs) and [wowanalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/). The main thing to check is if you're always casting: the timeline should have no downtime and, as close to zero as possible, cancelled casts. Another common issue is incorrectly planning your movement and wasting casts on dots: you should always have enough AP to cover some distance just by using spenders.

### What is Astral damage?

Astral damage is both Arcane and Nature damage. Effects that buff Nature spells also applies to Astral spells, and effects that buff Arcane spells likewise also applies to Astral spells. For example, Solar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Nature & Astral spells by 1.15x, and Lunar Eclipse multiplies the damage of all Arcane & Astral spells by 1.15x. If you have both eclipses, Astral spells get 1.15 \* 1.15 = 1.3225x multiplier, while Nature & Arcane spells get 1.15x.

Mind that class buffs only affect class spells so if a trinket does nature or arcane damage they are not affected by our buffs to these spell schools.

### How do I sim for AoE?

It is generally recommended that you steer away from simming unrealistic scenarios like "5 target 40 seconds" as they are likely to give skewed results. Balance Druid stats don't really change much depending on target count either, so you will be perfectly fine just using the default "1 target 5 minute patchwerk" options. If your intention is to sim for mythic+, you can use the [MDT Sim WeakAura](https://wago.io/Yya4XBbl-) which allows you to sim dungeon routes. Please keep in mind that ST damage is still a big part of mythic+.

### I'm doing really low damage in Mythic+, what am I doing wrong?

If you double-checked your rotation and still feel like you're underperforming you could just be playing low keys, together with classes that have very bursty damage profiles. When playing a Balance Druid, mobs need to live long enough for you to actually start doing damage, which is something that doesn't really happen in keys lower than 12+. Consider focusing a bit more on ST or trying another spec, but take into account the fact that DPS isn't everything in a key.

### I've seen a lot of people running build X instead of Y in Mythic+, is X better?

Try them out and make an informed decision! Most differences between builds are based on variables like target count, comps, combat timer or utility needed.

### Why are some top players running different embellishments from the ones mentioned in the Compendium

The DPS gain provided by the embellishments can vary significantly because of many external factors such as gear, type of content and group composition. Some of the top players might also happen to use niche embellishments for the same reasons. If you don't have any specific requirements then your best option is to just sim your character and choose the embellishments that provide the highest DPS upgrade.

### Do our dots snapshot?

No, all of our periodic damage (like !Moonfire!, !Sunfire!, !Stellar Flare!) do NOT snapshot, everything is dynamic. That means any dots gain/lose the damage bonus upon entering/leaving the Eclipse that buffs them and whenever any other stat/damage increases are applied/expire.

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems - 1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. Usually [Masterful Emerald](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=213482/masterful-emerald?crafting-quality=6) will sim better.

Weapon - [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths) for raid, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) or [Stormrider's Fury](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223762/enchant-weapon-stormriders-fury) for M+

Ring -  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot.

## Embellishments

BLIZZARD ARE STILL TUNING EMBELLISHMENTS. CHECK BACK IN LATER.

### What slot should I craft in?

You should always sim your character using Top Gear on Raidbots before making any gearing decision, but here are some guidelines:

- Bracers are often used as they have the lowest stat budget and can have a socket. This will be good later on when your other pieces can be upgraded to 639 itemlevel.
- Cloaks are another slot with the lowest stat budget, but they can't be socketed.
- Belts have a higher stat budget, but they can have a socket.

## Trinkets

[Spymaster's Web](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220202/spymasters-web) is a trinket with a passively stacking intellect buff, capping at 40 stacks and an on-use effect that gives you intellect based on the amount of stacks you've accumulated. Ideally this means you should save it for your 3rd use of !194223|Celestial Alignment!/!102560|Incarnation! if the fight timer allows for it. 

Please use Top Gear on [Raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot) in order to decide what trinkets to use/farm, but the following list should give you a good idea of some of the trinkets you will want to look out for. The list is in roughly power-level order assuming the highest item level versions of the trinkets.

## Macros

**Orbital Strike macro:**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

**Trinket macro:**

If you are using an on-use trinket that should go along with your cooldowns, use the following macro (/13 for top trinket slot, and /14 for bottom trinket slot)

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/cast [@cursor] Celestial Alignment
```

## Cancelaura Macros

### **Cancelling Starlord**

**Cancelling Starlord is entirely optional and does not give you more or less DPS.**

If you want to engage in this entirely optional method without incurring a dps loss, you should aim to cancel Starlord at any point in an Eclipse window where the buff is currently at less than two seconds, and you are about to use !Starsurge! to prevent overcapping.

```
#showtooltip
/cancelaura Starlord
```

## Useful WeakAuras and Plater Profile

### **Balance WeakAura Packs**

The following links lead to various balance druid WeakAura packs. These contain everything that's recommended to track to play at a high level. None of these are particular better or more useful than others, and which one you should use is up to your personal preference.

- [Shrom's Ultimate AP Bar](https://wago.io/GzpP7i8ic)
- [Oi Balance pack](https://wago.io/OiBalance)
- [Shrom's AP Bar - Standalone](https://wago.io/J5V9sTM0FK)
- [Jundies Plater Script](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa)

### **Casts until you can cast Starfire**

[Starfire Alerter](https://wago.io/rrtAyRQjF):
See the description of the WA for more details. This is not a required WA but will make it easier to not get into situations where you are wasting a Starfire cast inside Solar Eclipse.
