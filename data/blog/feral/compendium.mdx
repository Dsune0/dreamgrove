**What is a priority list?**

When reading the priority lists below, you should not think about these as steps to follow in a specific order. At any given point in combat, you should cast the first thing in the list that you are able to cast.

The way this section is written is very formulaic and has the same structure as the Action Priority List (APL) used in sims.

**Pre-Combat:**
1. !Heart of the Wild!
2. !Prowl!
3. !Rake! from stealth.

**Select which talents you have to filter the priority list:**

**Single Target Priority List:**

<details open>
<summary>Highest Priority: Cooldowns</summary>

1. !5217|Tiger's Fury! at 5 combo points or if you're missing 35+ energy, whichever happens first.
2. [*Apex Predator's Craving&&Bloodtalons] !Ferocious Bite! with !Apex Predator's Craving! procs if it won't disrupt procing !Bloodtalons!.

    - [*Wildstalker] !Rip! is up. AND
    - There isn't an !Adaptive Swarm! heading to your target, AND
    - !Adaptive Swarm! is either missing or about to expire with 1/2 stacks. For example, with 3 stacks, you would refresh as soon as !Adaptive Swarm! falls off.
5. [*Unbridled Swarm] !Adaptive Swarm! conditions change based on the amount of !391888|Adaptive Swarms! you have out:
    - If you have 3 !391888|Adaptive Swarms! with at least 2 stacks out, then you will target allies with priority 1 stack > 0 stack > 2 stacks.
    - If you have 2 or fewer !391888|Adaptive Swarms! of at least 2 stacks, cast on your enemy target when swarm is not on them, and is not traveling towards them.
6. [*Incarnation] !102543|Incarnation! if it's ready.
7. [*~Incarnation] !Berserk! if it's ready. This should always be paired with !5217|Tiger's Fury!.

    - You have 2 or fewer combo points outside !Berserk! or 3 or fewer inside !Berserk!.
10. [*Convoke the Spirits] You may also !391528|Convoke! if the fight is about to end. Usually you want to !391528|Convoke! with !Berserk!.

</details>

# Talents:

This section is still a work in progress and will be updated before raid/m+ release, so check back before then.

# Consumables:

## Potions

[Tempered Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=430599/tempered-potion) is your dps potion for every situation.

[Algari Healing Potion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=211880/algari-healing-potion) is the only health potion available. That being said, if you find yourself equipped with an engineering crafted piece, [Heartseeking Health Injector](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221910/tinker-heartseeking-health-injector) can situationally be a superior option.

## Food

[Feast of the Midnight Masquerade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222733/feast-of-the-midnight-masquerade), [Feast of the Divine Day](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=445112/feast-of-the-divine-day) and [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) are all essentially equal, with [Beledar's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222728/beledars-bounty) being by far the cheapest option.

## Phials

[Flask of Alchemical Chaos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212283/flask-of-alchemical-chaos) for every situation

## Weapon Oils/Stones

[Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone)/[Ironclaw Weightstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222510/ironclaw-weightstone) or [Algari Mana Oil](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224107/algari-mana-oil). These have extremely similar value, though you should default to [Ironclaw Whetstone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222503/ironclaw-whetstone).

## Augment Rune

[Crystallized Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224572/crystallized-augment-rune)

# Gearing:
 
## Stat Priority:

Sim yourself using [Raidbots Top Gear](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear). Do not follow any stat priorities.

## Gems and Enchants

Gems:  1x [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) or [Culminating Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213743/culminating-blasphemite) and a mixture of the other gems based on your sims. It is not worth slotting in a Stamina gem. Personally don't think [Elusive Blasphemite](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213746/elusive-blasphemite) is necessary as a Feral Druid, given that we already have a lot of speed, but it would be a disservice to not mention it.

Weapon:  [Authority of the Depths](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223784/enchant-weapon-authority-of-the-depths) or [Authority of Radiant Power](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223781/enchant-weapon-authority-of-radiant-power) The former provides better pure single target damage, while the latter is better with more targets-- and Neru'bar Palace has a lot of adds. Thereotically, [Stonebound Artistry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223765/enchant-weapon-stonebound-artistry) is the best for pure AoE, but that is fairly rare.

Chest:  [Crystalline Radiance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223692/enchant-chest-crystalline-radiance)

Cloak:  [Chant of Winged Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223731/enchant-cloak-chant-of-winged-grace)

Legs:  [Stormbound Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219911/stormbound-armor-kit)

Wrist:  [Chant of Armored Avoidance](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223713/enchant-bracer-chant-of-armored-avoidance)

Boots:  [Defender's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223656/enchant-boots-defenders-march) or [Scout's March](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223653/enchant-boots-scouts-march)

Ring:  You should always sim your own character to determine what enchant to use in this slot. They tend to be very close. If you don't want to sim, [Radiant Mastery](https://www.wowhead.com/item=223677/enchant-ring-radiant-mastery) is usually a safe choice.

## Crafting

*This is prone to be updated with tuning. Dreamgrove is not responsible for any mistakes made in crafting if you do so before Mythic week.*

- [Charged Halberd](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222448/charged-halberd?bonus=8791&class=11&ilvl=636&spec=103) (or any crafted 2h agi weapon) with [Darkmoon Sigil: Ascension](https://www.wowhead.com/item=226022/darkmoon-sigil-ascension). An alternative if you are out of combat a lot is [Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens)
- [Binding of Binding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=215133/binding-of-binding) if you have a partner you can trade with, otherwise sim the best slot for your gear using [Writhing Armor Banding](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219506/writhing-armor-banding) or [Elemental Focusing Lens](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213770/elemental-focusing-lens). For mythic+ you should use [Dawnthread Lining](https://www.wowhead.com/item=222868/dawnthread-lining)
- To be updated sometime after Heroic week.

Special Note: You can craft 610 PvE item level PvP gear with [Forged Gladiator's Heraldry](https://www.wowhead.com/item=210233/forged-gladiators-heraldry) and slot your 2nd embellishment slot on that at the start. This requires farming 525-700 conquest depending on item slot. This item can additionally be socketed by farming Honor to purchase [Vicious Jeweler's Setting](https://www.wowhead.com/item=213778/vicious-jewelers-setting).

## Trinkets

These trinket lists are in rough order of strength, assuming the highest item level version of the items. You should always sim your own character to determine which trinkets you should equip. At the time of writing, [Ovi'nax's Mercurial Egg](https://www.wowhead.com/item=220305/ovinaxs-mercurial-egg) is bugged in-game. This is potentially a strong option, but until we see this trinket on live servers it won't be on the list.

**For use in Raid:**
- [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) This is by far our strongest raid trinket, especially with Wildstalker.
- [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Treacherous Transmitter](https://www.wowhead.com/item=221023/treacherous-transmitter?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) No reason to use this trinket since [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) is farmable, easier to use, and stronger. Play as 2 minute CD.
- [Void Reaper's Contract](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212456/void-reapers-contract?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Dead-eye Spyglass](https://www.wowhead.com/item=159623/dead-eye-spyglass?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)

**For use in Mythic+:**
- [Skardyn's Grace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=56115/skardyns-grace?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) In keys, this is a must-have trinket. It's farmable and also clearly the best choice.
- [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Ara'kara Sacbrood](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219314/ara-kara-sacbrood?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103) This is particularly potent in AoE, so you can make a case that it's better than [Mad Queen's Mandate](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212454/mad-queens-mandate) in some situations.
- [Dead-eye Spyglass](https://www.wowhead.com/item=159623/dead-eye-spyglass?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Empowering Crystal of Anub'ikkaj](https://www.wowhead.com/item=219312/empowering-crystal-of-anubikkaj?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)
- [Void Reaper's Contract](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212456/void-reapers-contract?class=11&ilvl=639&spec=103)

# Miscellaneous:

## What is snapshotting?

Snapshotting refers to the process of continually ensuring that your strongest bleeds are ticking on your targets. The strength of feral bleed ticks is snapshotted (calculated) at the moment of application and lasts for the duration of the bleed. If certain buffs are active when the bleed is applied, such as !5217|Tiger's Fury!, the damage of its snapshot will be stronger. A good feral player is aware of this and will weave between applying stronger bleeds and leaving currently ticking bleeds alone. 

Tracking the strength of different bleeds across multiple/changing mobs is notoriously difficult, so we recommend the use of Weak Aura bleed packages such as those found in dreamgrove.gg. All our WA packages follow the same general format:
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in green or its number is higher than 100: this is a stronger bleed than the one you currently have active.
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in grey or its number is equal to 100: equal value bleed
* If the bleed’s icon is highlighted in red or its number is lower than 100: this is a weaker bleed than the one you currently have active.

Note: You will not necessarily upgrade every snapshot. Please review the rotation section.

__Which bleeds are snapshotted?__

1. All Feral bleeds will snapshot at higher values when paired with !5217|Tiger's Fury!
2. !Rake! will also snapshot 
    - !Prowl!
    - !58984|Shadowmeld!
    - !Sudden Ambush! procs due to !390772|Pouncing Strikes!
3. !Rip! will also snapshot !Bloodtalons!
4. !Thrash! will also snapshot !236068|Moment of Clarity!

A bleed will ideally be applied only when 30% or less of the prior bleed remains. This triggers a mechanic known as “pandemic,” which is common to most damage over time spells.  

## What is “pandemic range?”
This term refers to a DoT mechanic in WoW. The baseline duration of a DoT can be extended by up to 30% if a target is already affected by that DoT. Due to the 30% cap on extension, DoTs generally shouldn't be refreshed too early, as potential ticks will be lost. The ideal window of time to refresh a DoT is known as its “pandemic range.” 

Let’s use an example. Consider a 10 second DoT:
* Refresh with 1s remaining: the new DoT will be 11s long (10s baseline duration + 1s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 3s remaining: the new DoT will be 13s long (10s baseline duration + 3s from prior DoT)
* Refresh with 8s remaining: the new DoT will still be 13s long (10s baseline + up to 30% from prior DoT)

It is therefore most efficient to wait until 70% or more of your bleed has ticked to refresh its DoT. 

Fun trivia: the name “pandemic” derives from an old warlock passive that was eventually integrated as a baseline feature of damage over time spells. 

__What is “clipping?”__

Clipping refers to refreshing a dot prior to its pandemic window. Sometimes you will want to do this with Feral because of snapshotting and/or !Bloodtalons!.

## Macros

Here, we provide a list of helpful macros. These macros are not _required_, but using them may elevate your gameplay. (_Note:_ These macros are not set in stone. Customize them as you see fit!)

**Cast Ursol's Vortex at your cursor location (@cursor macro):**

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@cursor] Ursol's Vortex
```

**Use your trinket(s) and/or weapon at the same time as an ability:**

Some trinkets and weapons should be used with a major cooldown. A lot of players will bind these items with Berserk. 
* 13 is the top trinket slot
* 14 is the bottom trinket slot
* 16 is your weapon slot

If you would like to use all three items with Berserk, use this macro:

```
#showtooltip
/use 13
/use 14
/use 16
/cast Berserk
```
This macro may be modified. For example, the macro below only uses the 2nd trinket with Berserk:

```
#showtooltip
/use 14
/cast Berserk
```

**Cast Entangling Roots on your mouseover target:**

This macro casts Entangling Roots on your mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Entangling Roots on your current target.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] [] Entangling Roots
```

**Dispel/Soothe on the same bind:**

This is the classic help/harm macro, but using mouseovers as well.

```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, harm, nodead] Soothe; [@mouseover, help, nodead] Remove Corruption; [harm, nodead] Soothe; Remove Corruption
```

**Skull Bash your Focus target:**

This macro casts Skull Bash on your focus target. If you have not set a focus target, the macro instead casts Skull Bash on your current target.

We recommend creating a keybind that will assign a target as your focus with one click. This option can be found in the game's keybind settings. 
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@focus, harm, nodead] [] skull bash
```

**Cast Adaptive Swarm on your ally or enemy mouseover target:**

This macro casts Adaptive Swarm on a friendly mouseover target. If your mouse is not hovering over a target, the macro instead casts Adaptive Swarm on your current target.

Many abilities that are cast on allies - Rejuvenation, Regrowth, Innervate, etc - may be macro'd in this fashion. To make those macros, simply replace the term "Adaptive Swarm" with your spell of choice.
If you want mouseover to work for both friendly and enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'exists'. If you want it to only work on enemy targets, replace 'help' with 'harm'.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] [] Adaptive Swarm 
```

**Cast Rebirth on an ally:**

This macro casts Rebirth on your current friendly but dead mouseover target. If your ally is alive, the macro instead casts Mark of the Wild.
```
#showtooltip
/cast [@mouseover, help, dead] Rebirth; Mark of the Wild
```
 
## Useful WeakAura(s) and Addons

### **Full WeakAura Packages for Feral**
To play feral competently, many variables must be tracked. A single WeakAura is not up to this task, so our contributors have spent many hours assembling full WA packages from individual WeakAuras. 

Each package contains multiple WeakAuras that work with each other to help you understand what's happening in combat. No package is superior to the others in the list. We recommend you try out several, and settle on your favorite.
